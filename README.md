## Use and Installation

1. The first step is to **download the executable file** of the latest version.
2. **This file will take care of preparing the actual installer (strange that it is an installer for an installer).
3. Now the actual installer will **start itself**.
4. If you don't want to read the introductory file, type **[this page](https://github.com/ProjecVirgil/VirgilAI)**, go ahead.
5. **Accept the "license"**.
6. OK, now the important part: all options have their own explanation, just click **these buttons:** ![img](/docs/img/img_button.png) once the options have been chosen, go ahead.
7. If the installation takes more than 10/15 minutes, contact support (via github or otherwise).
8. Now go ahead and **save the key**.
9. You can **now run VirgilAI** by simply searching for it in the search bar.

## Modify the installation

> Simple re-run the installer and you can modify the config of installation

## Environment installation | In details

### So the installer install python version 3.11.7

- If you have the same version of python should not overwrite the current

- If you have a different version of python it will not overwrite the current one in the path, and when the installer uses python, it will use the installation path directly.

### Python library

VirgilAI use the venv environment so the libraries **will not overwrote**

## Manual installation modification

For modify the installation manually go on the path of installation generally `C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Programs\Virgil-Installer` and search `config.json`

The basic config can appear like this, simple modify and save the file

```json
{
  "first_start": true,
  "startup": false,
  "specify_interface": false,
  "type_interface": "N",
  "installation_path": "C:\\Users\\deadr\\AppData\\Local\\Programs",
  "icon_on_desktop": true,
  "display_console": true,
  "key": ""
}

## Credits

The project is made by one person and is still in development, I'm looking for someone to give me advice and a hand to continue the project, which I believe is an excellent open source and free alternative to devices like Alexa or Google Home.
